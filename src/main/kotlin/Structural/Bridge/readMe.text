There are two packages: Abstraction and Implementation. Such names are needed just to
understand the sense of pattern, abstraction here is
just a client desired interface for the application
within all necessary functionality. And Implementation
is a low-level device(application) possibilities, which
allow to make high-level(Abstraction) functions of application.

Here is not an application with GUI(which should be perceived as an Abstraction), but a simple
remote controller emulation for some devices.
